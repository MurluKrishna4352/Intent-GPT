## 📊 Overview

**Intent GPT** is a sophisticated question-answering model focused on **financial reports**. Built using cutting-edge natural language processing techniques, this AI-driven solution allows users to interact with complex financial data intuitively. Rather than providing general insights, Intent GPT empowers users to ask detailed, specific questions regarding financial statements, such as balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow reports. Our model understands financial terminology and provides accurate, context-aware answers.
